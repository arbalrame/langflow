Hachiko would accompany his master to the Shibuya train station every morning and wait for him to return every evening. One day in 1925, Ueno suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died at work, leaving Hachiko waiting at the station. Hachiko continued to wait for his master every day for the next nine years, nine months and fifteen days, until his own death in 1935. Hachiko became a national symbol of loyalty and devotion in Japan, and a bronze statue of him was erected at Shibuya station in 1934.
